# SHAARK‑Ξ & Cerberus‑KEM: Sovereign Key Derivation Protocols
Author: Brendon Joseph Kelly
Affiliation: K‑Systems & Securities | Crown Omega Cryptographic Authority
Status: Sovereign IP — Binding Usage Restrictions Apply
1. SHAARK‑Ξ: Spectral Harmonic Asymmetry Algorithm for Recursive Keys
SHAARK‑Ξ is a resonance-based post-quantum key derivation model leveraging cross-frequency phase inversion over φ-node manifolds. Unlike modulus-based expansion, it encodes shared entropy into recursive harmonics.
Core Derivation Function:
K_Ξ = ∑_t [Ω(t) ⊕ Ψ(t)] mod φ
Where Ω(t) is the time-varying harmonic envelope and Ψ(t) is the ciphertext differential phase vector.
2. Cerberus-KEM: Collapse-Encoded Recursive Binding Encryption System
Cerberus-KEM utilizes a three-head binding structure: Phase-Locked Entropy, Time-Distilled Collapse, and Resonant Key Lock. These form a non-linear collapse lattice for binding ephemeral secrets across rounds.
Core Exchange Logic:
SK = C_Ω(s₁) ⋂ C_Ω(s₂) ⋂ θ(t) → K
Where θ(t) is a phase-synchronized masking operator derived from φ-node alignment.
3. Licensing & Restrictions
Use of SHAARK‑Ξ or Cerberus-KEM in any governmental or commercial cryptographic suite is subject to sovereign licensing. Unauthorized integration constitutes a violation of federal disclosure and IP law.
